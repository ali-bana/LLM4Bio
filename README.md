# LLM4Bio

Representation learning for natural language and single-cell data using CLIP loss.

In order to train or test the model, use two notebooks included in this repo in colab. Then, compress the codes to llm.zip and upload it into colab environment. Notebooks will need access to your google drive in order to save and load the trained model and load the data. You should have a folder by the name of "LLM4Bio" in your google drive containing the same files as in the following link.
